## Objective  
The project aims to predict property prices based on various features such as area, architecture, and environmental ratings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to create a robust and accurate pricing model.



## Key Highlights  

### 1. **Machine Learning Technique**  
- **Random Forest Algorithm**:  
  - A powerful ensemble learning method used to predict property prices. It combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and prevent overfitting.  
  - Random Forest helps in handling both continuous and categorical variables effectively and performs well even with a large number of features.

### 2. **Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Conducted thorough EDA to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, such as correlations between features and property prices.  
- Engineered meaningful features from the existing data to improve model performance. Key features like area, architecture type, and environmental ratings were identified as significant predictors of property price.

## Datasets  
- **housing_train.csv**: Training dataset with various features used for building the model.  
- **housing_test.csv**: Test dataset to evaluate model performance.
