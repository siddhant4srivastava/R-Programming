This repository showcases the R projects completed as part of my training with **Edvancer Eduventures**, where I honed my data science and machine learning skills. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving using various statistical and machine learning techniques, along with the effective use of R for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.  


### **1. Real Estate Price Prediction**  
**Objective:** Predict property prices based on features like area, architecture, and environmental ratings.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Implemented Ridge and Lasso regression techniques to handle multicollinearity and improve model performance.  
- Used feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about the dataset.  
- Datasets: `housing_train.csv` and `housing_test.csv`.  


### **2. Employee Turnover Prediction**  
**Objective:** Predict whether valuable employees are likely to leave prematurely.  
**Key Highlights:**  
- Built a Random Forest classifier model to submit probability scores for employee turnover.  
- Conducted feature selection and importance analysis to identify top factors influencing attrition.  
- Datasets: `hr_train.csv` and `hr_test.csv`.
