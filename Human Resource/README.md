# Employee Attrition Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on various features, such as satisfaction level, time spent in the company, and promotion history.

## Project Overview

The project uses a dataset (`hr_train.csv` and `hr_test.csv`) containing employee data, with the target variable `left` representing whether the employee left the company (1) or stayed (0). The objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast employee attrition.

### Features:

- **satisfaction_level**: Satisfaction level of the employee.
- **last_evaluation**: Last evaluation score for the employee.
- **number_project**: Number of projects handled by the employee.
- **average_monthly_hours**: Average monthly working hours.
- **time_spend_company**: Number of years the employee has spent in the company.
- **Work_accident**: Whether the employee has had a work accident (binary).
- **promotion_last_5years**: Whether the employee had a promotion in the last 5 years (binary).
- **sales**: Department the employee belongs to.
- **salary**: Employee's salary level.

### Target:
- **left**: Whether the employee left the company (1) or stayed (0).
